					<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	I enjoy expressing myself creatively though a variety of avenues. 
						From traditional and digital artwork to culinary attempts, I dabble with
						what inspires me - or in the case of food-related activities, I dabble
						with what sounds delicious.<br/> Due to my school and work schedule, I
						don't have much time to dedicate to hobbies. But I try to work on
						projects or try new skills whenever I get the opportunity.

					<h2>Gardening</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>My gardening hobby is mostly indoors - my room is filled with various plants that are mostly alive.
					   I'm still new to the hobby and learning as I go, the winter months pose a challenge in figuring out a 
					   new watering schedule. I've tried my hand at a few different plants now and had a variety of luck.
					   Pothos, some succulents, monstras, micans, sanservias, and alocasias have all done well and survived.
					   I've unfortunately struggled with carnivorous plants, lilies, orchids, and basically everything else.
					   Plants can be sensitive and I'm limited to the environment of my room, so some plants are difficult to
					   keep in those circumstances. In time I'll get the hang of it, I just need to keep throwing money at new
					   plants and trying new things until they stop dying.<br/>
					   <h4>I typically purchase my plants from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PlantlyAddicted">PlantlyAddicted</a>, a small etsy shop.</h4>

					<h2>Embroidery</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	Presently, I'm working on some embroidery kits to practice the different stitches and techniques before attempting
						my own designs. In the future, I'd like to embroider custom tote bags and jeans. Embroidery has been easy for me thus
						far, as well as relaxing. I enjoy working on a kit while watching shows. The only downside is how long it takes to 
						complete a design, but it doesn't bother me too much. The end result is worth the combined effort.

					<h2>Cooking &#38; Baking</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	Nothing beats fresh, homemade meals and baked goods. When I get the opportunity, I enjoy trying new recipes
						and learning different ways to combine ingredients. Following a recipe is simple enough in concept, but I've learned
						quickly that things tend to be more difficult in practice. Custards are a big example of this - they're as big of a pain
						to make as they are delicious. One batch doesn't cook enough in the middle, another will cook too much and burn, there's no
						winning. <br/>
						Another, less complicated, favorite dish of mine is spaghetti! Super easy to make with fresh ingredients without requiring
						a lot of effort. The fresh ingredients really make a difference in comparison to canned options. Taking an extra few minutes to 
						cut tomatos, onion, and basil is worth the resulting flavor.

					<h2>Digital Art</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	Most of my drawing is digital art using Clip Studio Paint. I'm not a pro by any means, but I typically
					   	can make things look like the things they're supposed to be. Lately I've been practicing sketching from
					   	life - specifically focusing on humans. People are hard to draw, bodies are weird when detailing; but I'm
					   	slowly getting the hang of it. I often use photos of my friends as references when sketching. I think I put
					   	more love and detail into art that I feel passionate about or connected to. Drawing my loved ones gives me
					   	the same feeling and motivation. In time I'll be able to draw without needing to heavily reference photos,
					   	but for now my crutch is helping me improve my skills.<br/>

					<h2>Music</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	I dabble with singing, digital music programs, and playing the ukelele. None of which I'm a pro at, but
						that doesn't make the hobbies any less fun. When I'm feeling inspired, I'll make up some tunes or attempt
						a song cover.<br/>
						My musical interests are more of a <i>"as the feeling hits me"</i> - which is why I don't dedicate as 
						much time to it as I do for my other hobbies - with the exception of singing. I'm taking vocal lessons with
						a local coach in between classes. This makes my schedule a bit tight, but I enjoy having dedicated time for
						practicing a skill.

					<h2>Gaming</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>I think my gaming niche is fantasy, creative games where I can immerse myself in the virtual world. It offers
					   me an escape from the real world into an imaginative reality of my own making. It almost feels like a level
					   up from the experience of reading a good book. My imagination can be brought to life in a way I can see
					   and interract with. It's really realaxing for me and offers a good long-distance activity to do with friends.
					   Presently, my go-to games are:
							<ul><li><b>Final Fantasy XIV</b></li>
						   	<li><b>Genshin Impact</b></li>
							<li><b>Phasmophobia</b></li>
							<li><b>Witch It</b></li></ul>
					   I play with others depending on what friends want to do, but these are my main titles. I'll play just about anything with friends.
