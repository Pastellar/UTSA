# First Website
This is my first website, which I'm creating in my Web Technologies class.
We are using AWS and will practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Assignments 1 - 5 explore HTML basics.
Assignment 6 is my introduction to CSS and Bootstrap, as well as the most detailed site I made in this class.

Link:   https://ec2-13-59-221-205.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
The above link takes you to the main index.html (Assignment 1).
To visit other versions of the site, include a "hw#" at the end
of the link - replace # with the assignment number you wish to
see.

Update: The AWS link no longer works due to the end of my free trial.
