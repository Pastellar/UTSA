# Simple Item Database Using [Bash]
 This program allows the user to create and manage
 items. New item data is read in from a txt file, 
 then stored in the data folder as a .item

 Through the menu, you can:
 - create
 - read
 - update
 - delete

This program was created for my Systems Programming class.
