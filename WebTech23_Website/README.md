The above link takes you to the main index.html (Assignment 1).
To visit other versions of the site, include a "hw#" at the end

Currently this class is in progress, I will be updating this 
repository as we progress through the assignments. Depending
on AWS pricing, I may keep this site up after the semester
concludes.
