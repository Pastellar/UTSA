					<h2>The Journey Thus Far</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Presently, I'm
						in my senior year and expect to graduate this December. During my time at UTSA, I've explored many
						areas throughout the Computer Science field. From concepts and theory to hands on programming, I've been
						able to dip my toes in most areas of the field. Computer Science is so broad and filled with potential, 
						it's both exciting and a little overwhelming to decide on a career path. Thanks to the guideance from
						my professors and peers, I feel I've made the most of my time at UTSA and developed a clear vision of
						my future. <br/>
						I plan to pursue research opportunities this coming Fall semester with focus on Artificial Intelligence
						and exploring its capabilities. Depending on how the research progresses, I may consider pursuing a Master's
						degree or continuing research at UTSA after graduation.

					<h2>Experience</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	I began working my first - and current - job at HEB back in March of 2018.
						My HEB journey started as a bagger and eventually evolved into cashering. From there I began cross-training
						in other departments to help where needed and further my understanding of store operations. In 2020, HEB
						launched the Cross Functional department. I was recommended by store management and moved departments in 2020.
						During my time in Cross Functional I became experienced with other store departments and was even requested to fill
						shifts in both Deli and Pharmacy. Later, in 2022, I was offered a position in Beauty as a Customer Service Representative.
						While I enjoyed my time in Cross Functional, my classes had begun to conflict with and complicate my schedule. 
						I moved to Beauty and have remained in that department to this day. <br/>
						Each department I've worked in has offered a unique learning experience that has expanded my understanding of store
						operations and improved my skills. I'm grateful for the learning opportunities I've had and do my best to apply this
						knowledge in Beauty.
					</p>

					<h2>Career Plans</h2>
					<hr>
					<p> Ideally, I would love to move up in HEB to HEB Digital. I've worked for this company for almost 5 years and am
						looking into corporate opportunities. I hope to land a summer internship with HEB to get my foot in the door and experience
						what day-to-day worklife might look like - as well as an opportunity to improve my skills. 
						I'm open to other opportunities and am actively looking for positions with focus on software development - though I am open
						to other areas in the Computer Science field.

					<h2>Goals</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	I want to explore Artificial Intelligence and its capabilities for mimicing human brain functionality. There's so much
						to be pioneered in A.I., and the prospect of discovering new advancements is exciting! As an example, I think A.I. has a lot
						of potential for improving modern medicine. Hypothetically, A.I. could be used to develop treatments or diagnose patients - 
						which could help a lot of people, especially in emergency situations. Our technology is a ways off from that hypothetical becoming
						reality, but I'm optimistic the possibility is there for our future.<br/>
						This coming Fall semester, I hope to explore Artificial Intelligence through an intependent study. I'm new to A.I., but I'm
						passionate about this research and think this is the perfect opportunity to familiarize myself with the subject. Presently, I'm
						trying to get a headstart by reading up on the necessary topics and pre-researching so that I can put this knowledge into
						practice next semester. I want to make the most of my time during the study by getting ahead now. Depending on how the research
						progresses, I may reconsider my future plans and shift my focus to continuing my studies.

					<h2>Gardening</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>My gardening hobby is mostly indoors - my room is filled with various plants that are mostly alive.
					   I'm still new to the hobby and learning as I go, the winter months pose a challenge in figuring out a 
					   new watering schedule. I've tried my hand at a few different plants now and had a variety of luck.
					   Pothos, some succulents, monstras, micans, sanservias, and alocasias have all done well and survived.
					   I've unfortunately struggled with carnivorous plants, lilies, orchids, and basically everything else.
					   Plants can be sensitive and I'm limited to the environment of my room, so some plants are difficult to
					   keep in those circumstances. In time I'll get the hang of it, I just need to keep throwing money at new
					   plants and trying new things until they stop dying.<br/>
					   <h4>I typically purchase my plants from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PlantlyAddicted">PlantlyAddicted</a>, a small etsy shop.</h4>

					<h2>Cooking &#38; Baking</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	Nothing beats fresh, homemade meals and baked goods. When I get the opportunity, I enjoy trying new recipes
						and learning different ways to combine ingredients. Following a recipe is simple enough in concept, but I've learned
						quickly that things tend to be more difficult in practice. Custards are a big example of this - they're as big of a pain
						to make as they are delicious. One batch doesn't cook enough in the middle, another will cook too much and burn, there's no
						winning. <br/>
						Another, less complicated, favorite dish of mine is spaghetti! Super easy to make with fresh ingredients without requiring
						a lot of effort. The fresh ingredients really make a difference in comparison to canned options. Taking an extra few minutes to 
						cut tomatos, onion, and basil is worth the resulting flavor.

					<h2>Gaming</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>I think my gaming niche is fantasy, creative games where I can immerse myself in the virtual world. It offers
					   me an escape from the real world into an imaginative reality of my own making. It almost feels like a level
					   up from the experience of reading a good book. My imagination can be brought to life in a way I can see
					   and interract with. It's really realaxing for me and offers a good long-distance activity to do with friends.
					   Presently, my go-to games are:
							<ul><li><b>Final Fantasy XIV</b></li>
						   	<li><b>Genshin Impact</b></li>
							<li><b>Phasmophobia</b></li>
							<li><b>Witch It</b></li></ul>
					   I play with others depending on what friends want to do, but these are my main titles. I'll play just about anything with friends.

					<h2>Music</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	I dabble with singing, digital music programs, and playing the ukelele. None of which I'm a pro at, but
						that doesn't make the hobbies any less fun. When I'm feeling inspired, I'll make up some tunes or attempt
						a song cover.<br/>
						My musical interests are more of a <i>"as the feeling hits me"</i> - which is why I don't dedicate as 
						much time to it as I do for my other hobbies - with the exception of singing. I'm taking vocal lessons with
						a local coach in between classes. This makes my schedule a bit tight, but I enjoy having dedicated time for
						practicing a skill.

					<h2>Embroidery</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	Presently, I'm working on some embroidery kits to practice the different stitches and techniques before attempting
						my own designs. In the future, I'd like to embroider custom tote bags and jeans. Embroidery has been easy for me thus
						far, as well as relaxing. I enjoy working on a kit while watching shows. The only downside is how long it takes to 
						complete a design, but it doesn't bother me too much. The end result is worth the combined effort.

					<h2>Digital Art</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	Most of my drawing is digital art using Clip Studio Paint. I'm not a pro by any means, but I typically
					   	can make things look like the things they're supposed to be. Lately I've been practicing sketching from
					   	life - specifically focusing on humans. People are hard to draw, bodies are weird when detailing; but I'm
					   	slowly getting the hang of it. I often use photos of my friends as references when sketching. I think I put
					   	more love and detail into art that I feel passionate about or connected to. Drawing my loved ones gives me
					   	the same feeling and motivation. In time I'll be able to draw without needing to heavily reference photos,
					   	but for now my crutch is helping me improve my skills.<br/>
