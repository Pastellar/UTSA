		<h2>Degree</h2>
		<p>My current degree of study is Computer Science. I plan to graduate Fall 2023 with a Bachelors.<br/>
		   I'm considering pursuing my Masters, but haven't decided yet. I'm antsy to kickstart my career <br/>
		   and don't know if I can afford another four years. We'll see, maybe an opportunity will pop up.

		<h2>Ideal Job / Interests</h2>
		<p>My current plan is to work in HEB Digital - or any other promising entry level opportunity. <br/>
		   I hope to get an internship this summer though HEB. It would get my foot in the door and be <br/>
		   great experience for future job opportunities. I currently work at my local HEB, this is why I'm<br/>
		   a bit adamant about moving up in the company - I've already worked here for 4 years, that may give <br/>
		   me some brownie points towards getting a job in Digital since HEB likes to train up their partners.<br/>
		   If possible, I would like to explore research in A.I. and its use in medical advancements. <br/>
		   There's much left to pioneer in A.I., the idea of discovering new advancements and programming something that <br/>
		   could help people is exciting to me. I hope to explore this through an independent study in the Fall.<br/>
		   This semester I'm taking Artificial Intelligence, and am exploring A.I. for the first time. I'm very new <br/>
		   to A.I. and have a lot to learn, but I think this is the perfect opportunity to learn the basics and continue<br/>
		   learning on my own through researching and practicing with it in the Fall. I'm trying to get a headstart on it<br/>
		   now by reading up on the topics my study would cover. If I wait till the Fall, I worry most of the semester will <br/>
		   be taken up by reading - leaving little to no time for putting that information into practice. I want to make the<br/>
		   most of the time I'll have, so I'm getting ahead where I can.<br/>

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
		   This semester is packed so I likely won't have much free time. But when I do have the opportunity, <br/>
		   I enjoy gaming or finding creative outlets through drawing, embroidery, singing, gardening, etc.
		   <br/>
	   		<ul>
				<h3>Gaming</h3>
				<li>I think my niche is fantasy, creative games where I can immerse myself in the virtual world. It offers <br/>
					me an escape from the real world into a happier reality of my own making. It almost feels like a level <br/>
					up from the experience of reading a good book. My imagination can be brought to life in a way I can see <br/>
					and interract with. It's really realaxing for me and offers a good long-distance activity to do with friends.<br/>
					Presently, my go-to games are:
						   <ul>
							   <li>Final Fantasy XIV</li>
							   <li>Genshin Impact</li>
							   <li>Phasmophobia</li>
							   <li>Witch It</li>
						   </ul>
					I play with others depending on what friends want to do, but these are my main titles. I'll play just about anything with friends.
			   </li>
			   <br/>
			   <h3>Gardening</h3>
			   <li>My gardening hobby is mostly indoors - my room is filled with various plants that are mostly alive. <br/>
				   I'm still new to the hobby and learning as I go, the winter months pose a challenge in figuring out a <br/>
				   new watering schedule. I've tried my hand at a few different plants now and had a variety of luck.<br/>
				   Pothos, some succulents, monstras, micans, sanservias, and alocasias have all done well and survived. <br/>
				   I've unfortunately struggled with carnivorous plants, lilies, orchids, and basically everything else. <br/>
				   Plants can be sensitive and I'm limited to the environment of my room, so some plants are difficult to <br/>
				   keep in those circumstances. In time I'll get the hang of it, I just need to keep throwing money at new <br/>
				   plants and trying new things until they stop dying.<br/>
				   <h4>I typically purchase my plants from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PlantlyAddicted">PlantlyAddicted</a>, a small etsy shop.</h4>
			   </li>
			   <br/>
			   <h3>Digital Art</h3>
			   <li>Most of my drawing is digital art using Clip Studio Paint. I'm not a pro by any means, but I typically <br/>
			   can make things look like the things they're supposed to be. Lately I've been practicing sketching from <br/>
			   life - specifically focusing on humans. People are hard to draw, bodies are weird when detailing; but I'm <br/>
			   slowly getting the hang of it. I often use photos of my friends as references when sketching. I think I put <br/>
			   more love and detail into art that I feel passionate about or connected to. Drawing my loved ones gives me <br/>
			   the same feeling and motivation. In time I'll be able to draw without needing to heavily reference photos, <br/>
			   but for now my crutch is helping me improve my skills.<br/>
			   <h4>I also like drawing cartoony dinosaurs - here's some of my art:</h4>

			   </li>
			   <br/>
			   <li>The singing hobby is new - I recently signed up for classes so I have something fun on my schedule in <br/>
			   between classes, homework, and my job. I was meant to begin a few weeks ago, but life had other plans.<br/>
			   The day after I scheduled my first session, I tested positive for COVID. Had to contact the teacher again <br/>
			   to let them know I had to push back the sessions for at least two weeks so I could recover. THEN the sessions <br/>
			   had to be pushed back another two weeks because the teacher had back to back conflicts come up on my scheduled<br/>
			   days. I guess the universe wanted me to get a little more settled in my school schedule before dedicating time<br/>
			   to a hobby - or it's trying to tell me I suck at singing and to turn back while I can lol. </li>
			</ul>
