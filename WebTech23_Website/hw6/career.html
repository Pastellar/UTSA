            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I began working my first - and current - job at HEB back in March of 2018.
              My HEB journey started as a bagger and eventually evolved into cashering. From there I began cross-training
              in other departments to help where needed and further my understanding of store operations. In 2020, HEB
              launched the Cross Functional department. I was recommended by store management and moved departments in 2020.
              During my time in Cross Functional I became experienced with other store departments and was even requested to fill
              shifts in both Deli and Pharmacy. Later, in 2022, I was offered a position in Beauty as a Customer Service Representative.
              While I enjoyed my time in Cross Functional, my classes had begun to conflict with and complicate my schedule. 
              I moved to Beauty and have remained in that department to this day. <br/>
              Each department I've worked in has offered a unique learning experience that has expanded my understanding of store
              operations and improved my skills. I'm grateful for the learning opportunities I've had and do my best to apply this
              knowledge in Beauty. </p>

            <h2>Career Plans</h2>
            <p>Ideally, I would love to move up in HEB to HEB Digital. I've worked for this company for almost 5 years and am
              looking into corporate opportunities. I hope to land a summer internship with HEB to get my foot in the door and experience
              what day-to-day worklife might look like - as well as an opportunity to improve my skills. 
              I'm open to other opportunities and am actively looking for positions with focus on software development - though I am open
              to other areas in the Computer Science field.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>I want to explore Artificial Intelligence and its capabilities for mimicing human brain functionality. There's so much
              to be pioneered in A.I., and the prospect of discovering new advancements is exciting! As an example, I think A.I. has a lot
              of potential for improving modern medicine. Hypothetically, A.I. could be used to develop treatments or diagnose patients - 
              which could help a lot of people, especially in emergency situations. Our technology is a ways off from that hypothetical becoming
              reality, but I'm optimistic the possibility is there for our future.<br/>
              This coming Fall semester, I hope to explore Artificial Intelligence through an intependent study. I'm new to A.I., but I'm
              passionate about this research and think this is the perfect opportunity to familiarize myself with the subject. Presently, I'm
              trying to get a headstart by reading up on the necessary topics and pre-researching so that I can put this knowledge into
              practice next semester. I want to make the most of my time during the study by getting ahead now. Depending on how the research
              progresses, I may reconsider my future plans and shift my focus to continuing my studies.</p>
