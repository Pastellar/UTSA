					<h2>Background</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>	For the past four years I've explored many areas in Computer Science and had the opportunity to put learned
						theory into practice. I'm no expert, but I'm very open to learning new skills and tend to pick them up quickly.
						Computer Science is an ever-evolving field and I'm happy to grow with it. <br/>
						Java and C are two of the most commonly used languages in my courses, so I'm familiar with both. I intend to
						practice Python this semester and utilize the language for my A.I. project. I might have an opportunity to
						familiarize myself with basic Javascript for my Web Technologies class later this semester.<br/>
						Overall, I consider myself to be flexible and open to improvement. I believe there's always things we can 
						improve about ourselves and our skills. This aspect of Computer Science is what I enjoy the most - no matter
						how much you know, there's always more to be learned.

					<h2>Projects</h2>
					<hr>
					<p> During my time at UTSA, I've worked on a mock CPU Scheduler, a small-scale IMDB-inspired database,
						a basic data entry application; and currently, this website.<br/>
						This semester I will work with a team to create an eCommerce website and a mock interview web application.
						I anticipate being limited by the scope of my classes and remaining semester time, but I'm excited to
						explore these projects and familiarize myself with new languages.<br/>
						Next Fall, I plan to conduct an independent study on A.I. and its potential uses in medical research.
						In between coursework and other commitments, I'm reading up on relevant topics to prepare myself ahead of 
						time for next semester. I hope to accomplish as much as possible within the semester - and hopefully continue
						my research afterwards.
