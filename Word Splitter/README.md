#   Word Splitter
    This program stores a dictionary of words into a hash set, then compares
    a designated input file against the hash set.

    During the comparison, any found words are counted and stored into an
    array of strings.

    The output file presents the original text, number of words found, 
    and what the found words are.

    Written in Eclipse for our Analysis of Algorithms class.
